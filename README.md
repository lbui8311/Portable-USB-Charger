# Portable-USB-Charger
ECE-491/492 Senior Design Capstone Project

# Description
This project aims to create a portable power bank called the LeBox, designed to power any USB-chargeable device. The LeBox's power supply will step down 115 VAC to 5 VDC from any wall outlet. The charging IC will then regulate the voltage further to 4.2V and charge the lithium-ion batteries. A power switch is installed before the boost converter, allowing the team to choose when to allow the batteries to send voltage to the microcontroller, display, and USB port. The batteries are to be charged to 100% of their capacity and then be in charge of powering the Atmega328PB, LCD, and the USB port to any external device, like a phone, will be connected for charging. A push button is connected to the ATmega328PB that will turn on the LCD and cycle through the different menus that display different information.
